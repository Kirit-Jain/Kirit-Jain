### My Best Projects

Here are a few projects I'm proud of.

###  Project Umbra-Core - (Actively in Development)

A fast-paced, first-person spellcaster where arcane magic clashes with cold steel. As a powerful mage, players wield elemental spells to dismantle legions of robotic enemies in this personal project I am building from scratch.

This is my passion project, designed to showcase a professional, scalable, and robust game architecture in Unity. I am focusing on creating a flexible spell system and challenging combat encounters.

**Key Features Implemented:**
- *Hybrid Aiming System:* Combines the precision of raycasting for hit detection with the visual satisfaction of tangible, moving projectiles.
- *Scalable Spell Architecture:* Uses a ScriptableObject-based system, allowing new spells (like the current Fireball and Ground Slash) to be added with unique behaviors and data without changing core combat code.
- *Dynamic Enemy AI:* Enemies that can patrol, chase, and engage the player in combat.

### Project 1: Rocket Booster
You are a nimble rocket trapped within a massive, shifting, three-dimensional labyrinth in space. The goal of each level is simple: find the safe pad. The challenge lies in the maze's architecture and the deadly, synchronized obstacles that block your path. It's a game of precision, timing, and pathfinding.

**Key Features:**
- *Precision Platforming:* The controls must be tight and responsive. This includes moves like thrust and rotate.
- *The Maze Itself:* The maze is more than just walls; it's a dynamic puzzle.
- *Obstacles (The Dodge Element):* The obstacles should feel like part of a rhythmic, mechanical system.

### Project 2: Royal-Run
A fast-paced infinite runner that challenges players to survive a never-ending course by dodging procedurally generated, physics-based obstacles.

**Key Features:**
- *Endless Procedural Generation:* The game creates a unique, endless level every time you play, ensuring high replayability.
- *Dynamic Physics Engine:* Utilizes Unity's Rigidbody and Physics Materials to create dynamic and unpredictable obstacles that are physically thrown at the player.
- *Score & Collection System:* Features a classic coin collection system to track the player's score and reward skillful play.
- *Risk/Reward Speed Boost:* Collect special "apple" power-ups for a burst of speed, adding a layer of risk and reward to the gameplay.

### Project3: Invaders
An action-packed on-rails shooter where players navigate a cinematic, predetermined path, blasting enemy ships while dodging intense waves of fire.

**Key Features:**
- *Classic On-Rails Action:* Delivers a classic arcade experience by guiding the player along a fixed path, allowing them to focus purely on aiming, shooting, and dodging.
- *Custom Boss Encounters:* As my own custom feature, I implemented dynamic boss battles where the forward camera movement pauses, locking the player in an arena to engage in a challenging, multi-stage fight.
- *Enemy Squadrons & Scoring:* Battle diverse squadrons of enemy ships and aim for a high score by chaining together attacks and avoiding damage.
